# C Minor
An experimental, proof of concept implementation of objects, classes, inheritance and polymorphism in C.
I started work on this because the state machine-system used in my game became too complicated and was too limited, so it was due for some refactoring.

Main caviat of using this, besides being unfinished, is sloppy machine code, which could be ironed out. Though, it'll never be as optimal as plain C++.
